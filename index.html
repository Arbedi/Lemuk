                    <img src="images/code.jpg" />
                    <p>
                        I have always struggled to find meaning as a single element 
                        of a whole that is composed of ~7.8 billion others. In examining this discomfort,
                        I've noticed that I can fill this void with fulfilment I gain from investing
                        time and energy into projects I believe to have potential to have a positive
                        impact on the world.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I started learning how to code after realizing that it will be an essential
                        skill to have in my engineering journey, and to build more complex systems that
                        will be able to receive instructions.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        As someone accustomed to writing mostly prose, my initial experience with programming
                        languages was anything but seamless. For sometime, I was stuck in the "How to Learn
                        How to Code" rabbit hole, gradually feeling more overwhelmed by the scope of the field.
                        This went on until I finally commited myself towards being more systematic when it comes 
                        to my approach to learn programming languages. I started intently following the well-thought-out
                        lesson plan of the courseware I enrolled in, and conscientiously tried to apply what I learned 
                        by creating projects with them. This simple methodology served me well, and accelerated the pace
                        at which I absored the languages drastically.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Hence, whenever a friend openly voices out their desire to learn how to code, I would 
                        always advise them to stop waiting for externally induced motivation from YouTube videos
                        and the likes. I also tell them that they shouldn't mull over the decision of "what language
                        they should learn." Instead, they should start as soon as they can and atomize the syllabus 
                        they're following.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        While on the topic, I did have a couple of friends ask me which online courses I took, so I
                        listed them out in a Notion page I made 
                        <a href="https://evergreen-front-2e8.notion.site/How-I-learned-to-Code-42f05b72aca446d2b4e9aef72e0c5cf3" target="_blank">here</a>.

                        3D-modeling has always interested me due to its friendliness towards the reiterative approach
                        touted by the Scientific Method. I found myself enamored by the hobby, yet unable to afford the cost of
                        procuring my own 3D-printer. Thus, I dabbled with the modelling part of the process in hopes of 
                        utilizing this knowledge in the future.

                    <p>
                        I have always been facinated by the concept of achieving optimal efficiency. 
                        This interest was sparked when I first heard about the concept of ego-depletion that was popularized by
                        Roy Baumeister. It was just so intuitive and appealing to the popular assumption that focus was a finite asset. 
                        Ego depletion was later debunked by Prof. Carol Dweck and colleagues' research. Which then got me even more 
                        invested into finding out how to eek out efficiency in the things we do.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        During this time, I started allocating some of this enthusiasm towards performance into my health.
                        I started abiding to a daily routine of exercise and trying out numerous methods of dieting (which was pretty hard
                        to stick to alone, since it was pretty hard to convince my 15 y.o. friends to also buy into the program). The one
                        form of dieting that I subscribed to was the "Ketogenic Diet." It's a bit too complex for someone with no 
                        qualifications, such as I, to explain here while giving the approach justice.
                        Glazing past that, it worked for me! I got results. But I also developed symptoms of body dismorphia and meant I
                        has to reject a slice of orange a friend offered me because I was afraid it will tip me off my daily balance and 
                        break my state of ketosis.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I had to put in work to address the issues I had stemming from my days as a greenhorn in the fitness journey
                        —- but I came out of it as a more disciplined and confident person. Although I do grow a bit anxious about the spike in
                        people interested in getting with the program for understandable, yet could be wrong reasons when taken to the extreme 
                        (e.g. seeking external validation, to project a commanding personality, hyper-fixated emulation, etc.), I'm hopeful that
                        there are enough people who started out having the same thoughts, as I myself also had, who are ready to steer them towards 
                        a more heathy approach to self-betterment.

                    <p>
                        I represented our shool's varsity team for a couple of years in Junior Highschool. 
                        I also continued to play the sport during the first year of Senior HighSchool.
                        Those days were some of the fondest ones I had that year. The camaraderie among shared 
                        between members who share the passion that you have for an activity was the main thing
                        that kept me attending practices. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Moreover, training for a sport with clear milestones (e.g. being able to return 
                        backspin serves, learning how to approximate the balls trajectory, properly shifting 
                        your weight, etc.) was tremendously helpful in terms of my approach towards bettering 
                        myself in other aspects of my life.

                        Tennis has always interested me because of its similarity with my most comfortable sport
                        (table tennis). A friend and I are planning to give it a shot and learn the basics to test 
                        out how transferable the skills I learned from my previous sport are in this new one.

                        This was the project my group came up in my first Hackathon. This particular Hackathon was hosted
                        by Impact Hub and was themed towards healthcare services.

                        We wanted to create an app that would serve as a local dictionary, magazine, and marketplace 
                        for medicine to try and address the health literary problem in the Philippines. I had no involvement
                        with the coding project, that was handled by the other members of our group who were WAY more skilled than I was. 
                        I had the responsibility of organizing and assigning tasks, handling the business aspect, and making our presentation.

                        We were a bit stressed because of the time constraints and our noviceness. Nonetheless, we had so much fun building the
                        project, and got to meet so many inspiring and amazing people. Although we didn't win anything, we learned so much that 
                        we were eager to jump to another one right after!

                    <img src="images/Tkinter.png" />
                    <p>
                        Our professor for the course CCC101 - Computer Programming 1 announced pretty early
                        on in the semester that our final project for his subject could be anything coded with Python.
                        I was struggling to decide on what I should make, but I knew I wanted it to have a GUI.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        A few months has passed and the time has come for me to start working on something — anything really.
                        The idea of making a Graph Transformer came to me while I was trying to teach one of my cousins the 
                        relationship between the conic section equations and their graphs. I did a quick google seach for something
                        like that online and couldn't find one. Of course, I could just use desmos but I wanted something more intuitive.
                        Thus, I started working on a program that would require only inputs that would be easier to understand for my younger cousin.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        (As an added bonus, I was able to find some gaps in my memory on the subject and managed to fill them up)
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Our professor did have a fair critique on it, which he pointed out after the presentation: 
                        "there is no grid on the graph." Indeed, this was noticed during the creation phase but matplotlib proved to be 
                        the most stable module to use with Tkinter, so I went with that.
